/**
 * In this algorithm, the hidden window size must be a power of two,
 * for example, 1024 bits.  The redundant bits must also be a power of
 * two, for example 32 bits.  Thus, the supported anti-replay window
 * size is the hidden window size minus the redundant bits.  It is 992
 * in this example.  The size of the integer depends on microprocessor
 * architecture.  In this example, we assume that the software runs on
 * a 32-bit microprocessor.  So the size of the integer is 32.  In order
 * to convert the bitmap into an array of integers, the total number of
 * integers is the hidden window size divided by the size of the
 * integer.
 *
 * struct ipsec_sa contains the window and window related parameters,
 * such as the window size and the last acknowledged sequence number.
 *
 * all the value of macro can be changed, but must follow the rule
 * defined in the algorithm.
